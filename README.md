# Microsoft Entra ID SSO Integration with Salesforce

## Platform and Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Salesforce
- Web Browser

## Objective
In this project, I demonstrate how to integrate Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) with the Salesforce application. The process begins by adding Salesforce from the **Enterprise applications** section in Microsoft Entra. I then configure the SAML-based SSO settings in both Microsoft Entra and the Salesforce platform. Once both sides are properly configured, I test the integration by assigning a user in Microsoft Entra to access Salesforce using the SSO method.

---------

### Add Salesforce app in Microsoft Entra
To add the Salesforce application in Microsoft Entra, I navigated to **Enterprise applications** > **New application** (pic1), searched for **Salesforce** in the search bar, selected it from the results, and clicked Create (pic2) to add it to the tenant:

</p>


### Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

1. To configure Micrsoft Entra SSO for Salesforce, I navigated to **Enterprise applications** > **Salesforce** > **Single sign-on**. On the Select a single sign-on method page, I chose **SAML**. Then, on the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, I clicked the edit icon under **Basic SAML Configuration** to modify the required settings:

2. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, I entered the required information from my Salesforce Developer account to complete the integration setup:

3. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, under the SAML Signing Certificate section, I selected and downloaded the **Federation Metadata XML** file. I saved it on my computer to use later when configuring the SSO settings in my Salesforce Developer account:

### Configure Salesforce SSO

1. In my Salesforce Developer account, I ensured that the SAML feature was enabled by navigating to: **Setup** > **Identity** > **Single Sign-On Settings**, clicking **Edit**, selecting **Enable SAML**, and then clicking **Save**:

2. I configured the SAML Single Sign-On settings in Salesforce by selecting **New from Metadata File**, clicking **Choose File** to upload the Federation Metadata XML file I had previously downloaded from my Microsoft Entra page, and then selected **Create**:

3. After uploading the file and clicking **Create**, Salesforce automatically generated metadata page with the metadata fields pre-filled with my Microsoft Entra information. I named this SAML configuration **EntraSSO** and clicked **Save**:

4. To enable the **EntraSSO** authentication method, I navigated to **Company Settings** > **My Domain** > **Authentication Configuration**, clicked **Edit**, selected the **EntraSSO** checkbox, and then clicked **Save**:

### Test SSO on a User

1. To test whether SSO was functioning correctly, I assigned the Microsoft Entra user **Pipa** to the Salesforce application. Then, I created a corresponding user account for **Pipa** on my Salesforce Developer site:

</p>

2. After creating user **Pipa** account in Salesforce, I logged into the Microsoft My Apps portal using the same Pipa Entra account. The Salesforce application appeared on the dashboard. Upon clicking it, I was redirected to the Salesforce site without needing to sign in again, confirming that the SSO configuration was working successfully:

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Salesforce using SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO). By configuring both platforms and exchanging metadata, I enabled seamless authentication for users. The final testâ€”logging in as the assigned Entra user and accessing Salesforce without re-entering credentials, validated that the SSO setup was functioning as intended. This integration enhances security and user experience by centralizing identity management through Microsoft Entra ID.

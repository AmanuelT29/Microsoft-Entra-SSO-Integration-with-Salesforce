# Microsoft Entra ID SSO Integration with Salesforce

## Platform and Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Salesforce
- Web Browser

## Objective
In this project, I demonstrate how to integrate Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) with the Salesforce application. The process begins by adding Salesforce from the **Enterprise applications** section in Microsoft Entra. I then configure the SAML-based SSO settings in both Microsoft Entra and the Salesforce platform. Once both sides are properly configured, I test the integration by assigning a user in Microsoft Entra to access Salesforce using the SSO method.
